# book-barify
Turn your favorite books into informative bar images!

This script can create "bar images" from books, or rather information about the books. The most basic form is a series of horizontal bars, where each bar represents one chapter, with the relative length of the bars representing the chapter length. There may be further customizations to this in the future. This is an easy and automated way to visualize any book or other data in this form.
